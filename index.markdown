- **Exchange Connectivity**: FIX, SBE, and proprietary protocols
- **Performance Optimization**: Lock-free algorithms, CPU cache optimization
- **Risk Management**: Real-time position and exposure calculations

### Recent Projects

#### Ultra-Low Latency Trading Platform
Built a complete trading platform achieving consistent sub-microsecond latencies for NSE connectivity. Implemented using modern C++20 with custom memory allocators and lock-free data structures.

#### Exchange Gateway Optimization
Reduced median latency from 45μs to 27μs for smart order routing across multiple exchanges including Bovespa, BMV, and TSX.

### Technical Stack

Languages: C++20, Python, Rust
Tools: GCC 13.1, Clang, CMake, Conan 2.0
Profiling: Tracy, libpcap++, Valgrind
